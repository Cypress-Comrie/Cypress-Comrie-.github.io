    In this blog post i'll be sharing with you guys what ive learned about the
    diffrent positions used in css.<br />
    i'll be using my logo/home button for the examples.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="subheading">relative</p>
  <p>
    The relative positon itself wont change much of anything it'll just keep
    what you have in the normal flow, but you can add properties like (top,
    bottom, left, right) to chnage its position on the screen which will include
    overlapping other elements
  </p>
  <img class="blog-photo" src="images/relative.PNG" alt="blog-photo" />
  <p>Here you can see its just fitting itself into the natural order</p>
  <br />
  <p class="subheading">Absolute</p>
  <p>
    This one is a little more janky, Instead of sitting in the natural flow of
    everything it'll create its own flow completly ignoring all the other
    elements, using the properties listed above also works diffrently. Instead
    of changing the position of where it is when things are normal. the distance
    changed will be from each of the containing elements sides.
  </p>
  <img class="blog-photo" src="images/absolute.PNG" alt="blog-photo" />
  <p>
    In this one its where I want the logo to be but it will stay in that corner
    forever
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="subheading">Fixed</p>
  <p>
    Fixed positions work similarly to Absolutes, It fixes the element to a
    visible portion of the view point that basically just means it'll stay on
    your screen even when you're scrolling away from it
  </p>
  <img class="blog-photo" src="images/fixed.PNG" alt="blog-photo" />
  <p>
    Last of all I scrolled down a little bit and the logo followed me down which
    would've happened on your screen aswell (unless you're on a phone)

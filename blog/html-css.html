    In this blog post i'll be sharing with you guys what ive learned about the
    diffrent positions used in css.
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="subheading">relative</p>
  <p>
    The relative positon itself wont change much of anything it'll just keep
    what you have in the normal flow, but you can add properties like (top,
    bottom, left, right) to chnage its position on the screen which will include
    overlapping other elements
  </p>
  <br />
  <p class="subheading">Absolute</p>
  <p>
    This one is a little more janky, Instead of sitting in the natural flow of
    everything it'll create its own flow completly ignoring all the other
    elements, using the properties listed above also works diffrently. Instead
    of changing the position of where it is when things are normal. the distance
    changed will be from each of the containing elements sides.
